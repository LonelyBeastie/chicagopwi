                <h2>BOTOX®</h2>
                <img class="pull-right" src="http://www.ljcsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/botox-vial-san-diego1.jpg">

                <p>Chicago Pain and Wellness Institute SC only administers FDA approved Botox produced by Allergan Inc.</p>
                <h4>WHAT IS BOTOX?</h4>
                <p>BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of both moderate to severe crow’s feet lines and frown lines between the eyebrows in adults. </p>
                <h4>HOW DOES BOTOX WORK?</h4>
                <p>BOTOX® Cosmetic targets one of the underlying causes of frown lines and crow’s feet—the repeated muscle contractions from frowning and squinting over the years. Your specialist will inject these muscles with BOTOX® Cosmetic to temporarily reduce muscle activity. You will begin to notice a visible smoothing of your crow’s feet lines and frown lines between your brows.</p>

                <h4>WHAT TO EXPECT</h4>
                <p>You may begin to notice results within 24 to 48 hours for moderate to severe frown lines, with results lasting up to 4 months.</p>

                <h5>Does BOTOX® Cosmetic treatment hurt?</h5>
                <p>Some patients report that being injected with BOTOX® Cosmetic feels like a pinch. Your specialist may use ice to numb the treatment area. If you are concerned about discomfort, your specialist may apply a topical numbing cream before administering your treatment.</p>

                <h5>What were common side effects seen in clinical studies?</h5>
                <p>Three percent of patients experienced eyelid drooping in the frown lines studies and 1% of patients experienced eyelid swelling in the crow's feet studies. Other possible side effects include: dry mouth; discomfort or pain at the injection site; tiredness; headache; neck pain; eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight and dry eyes; and allergic reactions. These are not all of the possible serious side effects of BOTOX® Cosmetic.</p>

                <h4>How do chemical peels improve the skin?</h4>
                <p>Chemical peeling is a procedure that aims to accelerate skin exfoliation by the use of chemical substances resulting in renewed, healthier looking skin and more uniform complexion.</p>
                <h4>Who can benefit from SkinMedica® peels?</h4>
                <p>SkinMedica® peels address the visible skin imperfections that result from skin aging and sun exposure, such as fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone and texture. Peels also address skin tone uneveness that can be caused by acne scarring or pigmentary changes. SkinMedica® offers a range of different strength chemical peels that we can select to provide the optimum treatment for your skin type.</p>
                <h4>How do I decide which particular peel is most beneficial for me?</h4>
                <p>During the initial consultation, we will evaluate your skin condition and recommend the appropriate peel regimen based on your needs.</p>
                <h4>Who is an ideal candidate for a chemical peel treatment?</h4>
                <p>Chemical peels are appropriate for patients with mild-to-moderate skin imperfections that result from skin aging and sun exposure, such as fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone and texture. Chemical treatments also address skin unevenness that can be caused by acne scarring or other pigmentary changes.</p>
                <h4>Can chemical peels be performed on patients with dark skin?</h4>
                <p>SkinMedica peels are appropriate for all skin types.</p>
                <h4>How do I prepare for a chemical peel treatment?</h4>
                <p>Any procedure or products that may increase skin sensitivity should be avoided before your chemical peel treatment. Ask your physician or skin care specialist for details.</p>
                <h4>What should I expect during the procedure?</h4>
                <p>The complete treatment is expected to take 30 minutes, which includes ample time to address any questions you may have, and a discussion on your post peel care. The actual application procedure is approximately 15 minutes. Tolerance to the procedure varies from patient to patient. Tingling or burning sensations are normal and expected reactions. A handheld fan can be used during the procedure to minimize discomfort, which usually subsides in a few minutes.</p>
                <h4>How will my skin look right after the chemical peel?</h4>
                <p>SkinMedica peels can leave yellowish tinge on the skin which is expected to last no longer than 2-3 hours. Mild to moderate redness is expected after any type of chemical peel procedure. The extent of redness varies from patient to patient. The face may appear redder than usual for some time after the treatment and completely resolves after the peeling is complete.</p>
                <h4>Will I peel after receiving a SkinMedica treatment?</h4>
                <p>We will provide you with in depth post-procedure instructions. Your post-peel regimen will include moisturizer appropriate for your skin type and sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 30+.</p>
                <h4>How can I protect my skin post peel?</h4>
                <p>Since the new skin is more susceptible to sunburn, extra precautions should be taken to limit sun exposure for at least one week after the peel. It is imperative to use a broad spectrum sunscreen product with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
                <h4>After the treatment, when can I resume my regular skin care regimen?</h4>
                <p>You can resume the use of your regular treatment products after you have completely finished peeling.</p>
                <h4>What results can I expect after the peel?</h4>
                <p>After the SkinMedica peel, patients will notice an improvement in the appearance of overall skin condition, diminishment in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, smoothness of skin texture, more even skin color, and improved skin clarity.</p>
                <h4>How often can I have the treatment performed?</h4>
                <p>SkinMedica treatments can be repeated every 3-4 weeks.</p>
                <h4>How many treatments are required?</h4>
                <p>Multiple treatments may be required to achieve desired results. The number of treatments is based on initial level of skin damage, and can vary from 3 to 6. The effect of the peel is cumulative.</p>
                <h4>Can pregnant or lactating women receive a chemical peel?</h4>
                <p>SkinMedica® peels should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women.</p>
                <h4>Before and After</h4>

                <hr>
                <h4>WHAT IS LATISSE?</h4>
                <p>LATISSE® is an FDA-approved treatment to grow eyelashes for people with inadequate or not enough lashes.

                <h4>WHAT TO EXPECT</h4>
                <p>Great eyelashes don't just happen overnight. That's why it's important to note that LATISSE® solution works gradually and remarkably — with full results at week 16. Once you begin, you must continue applying the topical solution each night and follow the directions for best results. If you stop using LATISSE® at any time, your eyelashes will return to their previous appearance over several weeks to months.

                <h4>WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF LATISSE?</h4>
                <p>LATISSE® does have some side effects, the most common of which are an itching sensation in the eyes and/or eye redness. These were reported in approximately 4% of patients.
                <p>Other less common side effects typically occur on the skin close to where LATISSE® is applied, or in the eyes. These include eyelid skin darkening, eye irritation, dryness of the eyes, and redness of the eyelids. Eyelid skin darkening is a result of increased melanin in the skin, making your eyelid skin look a little darker close to where the solution is applied to the skin. This is expected to reverse after several weeks to months if you decide to stop using the product.

                <hr>
                <p>An intercostal nerve block reduces the inflammation of tissues by injecting local anesthetic around the intercostal nerves that are located under each rib. This is most useful</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a procedure that uses an electrical current to treat chronic pain. Spinal cord stimulation is most often used for patients with chronic and severe neuropathic pain, who have not responded to conservative treatments. Patients with the following conditions may benefit from SCS: post-laminectomy pain syndrome, radiculopathy, diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Implanting the stimulator is typically done using a local anesthetic and a sedative. We will first insert a trial stimulator through the skin (percutaneously) to give the treatment a trial run.  If the trial is successful, a more permanent stimulator may be implanted. </p>

                <h2>Kyphoplasty</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Patients with vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) who do not respond to conservative treatment or whose pain is unbearable may be helped by vertebral augmentation. This minimally invasive procedure uses a balloon catheter to create a void in the fractured vertebra, which is then filled with acrylic bone cement. Most experts believe that pain relief is achieved through mechanical support and stability provided by the bone cement. Vertebral augmentation is a well-established treatment for patients suffering from painful VCFs caused by osteoporosis, metastatic spinal tumors, and multiple myeloma. Benefits include measurable pain relief, increased range of motion, return to previous levels of activity, improved quality of life, and low complication rate.  The overall success rate for vertebral augmentation in treating osteoporotic fractures is approximately 85% to 90%.  Patients experience a dramatic reduction in pain, increased mobility, and improved overall quality of life.</p>

                <p>One in six Americans suffers from back pain every day.  Facet joints are a well-recognized source of pain in patients with persistent back pain.  There are options for relieving facet joint pain. Radiofrequency ablation (also called radiofrequency neurotomy or lesioning) is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide lasting relief to those suffering from facet joint pain.[5] In fact, multiple clinical studies show that radiofrequency neurotomy significantly reduces pain severity and frequency for one to two years in the majority of patients.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Chronic pain is more than a purely physical sensation. It is the result of physiological, emotional and psychosocial factors all of which interact in a dynamic (complex) way to create the pain experience.  Addressing the psychological aspects of chronic pain which can include sadness, anxiety, anger and hopelessness, is an essential component of successful pain management and can reduce the intensity of pain.  In some instances psychological treatments can be as effective as injections and other medical treatments in alleviating pain just by changing the ways your brain processes pain sensations. Finally, studies have shown that your beliefs about pain treatments significantly impact whether of nor you will benefit from those treatments.</p>
